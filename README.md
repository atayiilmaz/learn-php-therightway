#### This exercise for making practise mvc structure in pure PHP.

---
#### Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local or download it.
2. If you are using docker you can `cd` into the docker directory & run `docker-compose up -d`. If you are using something else like XAMPP just make sure you have Web Server (Apache), PHP & MySQL running.
   * Please note that **PHP 8** is required if you want to use the skeleton that I am providing. You will need to adjust the code to make it work for lower PHP versions.
3. Create a `.env` file by copying variables from `.env.example`. Fill in those values in `.env` file.
4. Make sure that whatever database name you enter actually exists, if not, create that database.
5. Confirm that once you open your `http://localhost:8000` it loads the home page.
